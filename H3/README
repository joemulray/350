CS 350 Homework 1 Part 3

Did not come across any issues when running. I included two files this time each with every question, and have taken them multiple times.
I also noted some of the functionalitys below such as functions that load files, others that use the current file loaded. Main Class: Main.java, calls Start.java has most of the functionality with creating Surveys, and Tests. `cd` into the src folder and run make. Put a copy of this README in there also.


Modify: Loads a file that was already created, after making changes you need to save for them to be noted in other functions, will not save automatically.
Tabulate: uses current file so you load the file you want.
Take: Loads a file that was created.
Grade: uses current file, so take test first then call grade.

> PATHS:
src/ : holds all source code, and makefile also a copy of this readme
ser/ : hold all serialization files, Tests stored in ser/Test/ directory and Surveys stored in ser/Survey/

> Makefile commands:

run : can run make build and compile
view : view all source code
clean : remove all class files and main jar file
docs : generate javadoc files
remove : remove all serialization files
