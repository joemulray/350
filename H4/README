Did not come across any issues when running. I included two files this time each with every question, and have taken them multiple times.
I also noted some of the functionalitys below such as functions that load files, others that use the current file loaded. Main Class: Main.java, calls Start.java has most of the functionality with creating Surveys, and Tests. `cd` into the src folder and run make. Put a copy of this README in there also. Also printed the following lines along with the text to speech functionality. Fixed some of the minor stuff from last homework. Had some minor issues originally with serialization and the FreeTTS files, but got working overall.


> PATHS:
src/ : holds all source code, and makefile also a copy of this readme
ser/ : hold all serialization files, Tests stored in ser/Test/ directory and Surveys stored in ser/Survey/
libs/ : holds all the library jar files

> Makefile commands:

run : can run make build and compile
view : view all source code
clean : remove all class files and main jar file
docs : generate javadoc files
remove : remove all serialization files

Modify: Loads a file that was already created, after making changes you need to save for them to be noted in other functions, will not save automatically.
Tabulate: uses current file so you load the file you want.
Take: Loads a file that was created.
Grade: uses current file, so take test first then call grade.
