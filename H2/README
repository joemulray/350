Makefile included just run make, will create jar file and execute program for you.

Main Driver is Main.java,  calls Start which creates Surveys, and Tests. Did not come across any issues when running. Included javadoc comments throughout program, can run make docs and it will generate for you if you want to view them. Also left the option to set a correct answer for ShortAnswer and Essay, and put needs grading when prompted. Also used serialization to store objects did not include any of precreated tests or surveys with zip so will have to create one before loading. 

PATHS:
src/ : holds all source code, and makefile also a copy of this readme
ser/ : hold all serialization files, Tests stored in ser/Test/ directory and Surveys stored in ser/Survey/

README is also included in src/ folder for quick access
